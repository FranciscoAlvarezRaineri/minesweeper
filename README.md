# Minesweeper
The clasic minesweeper game

This is just a Javascript exercise in which I coded a web-based full working minesweeper. </br>
The game already basically works as intended and has been abandoned. </br>
At least until I decide to learn Typescript and perhaps try to re-code it as an exercise. </br>
If you want to try it out, it's hosted at: https://elbuscaminas.netlify.app </br>
If you decide to take a look into the code, please consider I had been learning Javascript for around a month at this point.
