# Minesweeper
The clasic minesweeper game

This is just a Javascript exercise in which I coded a web-based full working minesweeper.
The game already basically works as intended and has been abandoned.
At least until I decide to learn Typescript and perhaps try re-coding it as an exercise.
If you decide to take a look into the code, please consider I had been learning Javascript for less than a month at this point.
